# GIS

* Spatial data management
* Data analysis
* Results management

The frame where geo-referenced information makes sense. The common place
where different roles collaborate. The flow in which information is organized
and processed.

# Connecting points

Spatial analysis connects information from different fields. It gives
the connection link: where.

# Significance of where

Aprox. 70% of all the information is geo-referenced.

# GIS subsystems

* Data. I/O, storage, process.
* Visualization. Maps, labels, edition.
* Analysis. Methods, processes, formulas.

# Visualization

Visualization is a Layer with upper L. It's a key entry point for most people.
Visualization is the inherent way of managing geo-referenced information.

# Neogeography

The popularization of geo-referenced information is creating a new group of people
who use GIS for personal and professional activities.

Low-cost geo devices allow them to imagine new ways of understanding geo-referenced
information: GPS devices, IoT, etc.
